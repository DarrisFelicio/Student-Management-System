# Student-Management-System

A simple C++ project created to manage students based on its role number, age, and name. 
This project offers different kind of feature such as : 
- Adding New Students
- Display Students Name
- Student Searching
- Edit Attributes
- Delete Student
This is a self initiated project that taught me alot about classes and Object Oriented Programming in the language of C.
